<objective>
Create a consolidated pre-beta operations checklist documenting every operational prerequisite that must be completed before inviting real users to the VLVT beta.

Purpose: Operational prerequisites are currently scattered across STATE.md, PROJECT.md, CONCERNS.md, and phase summaries. A single actionable checklist prevents items from being missed during beta launch preparation.
Output: `docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md` with categorized, verifiable action items.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create pre-beta operations checklist</name>
  <files>docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md` with the following structure and content. This is a documentation-only task -- no code changes.

The checklist must include ALL of the following items, organized by category. Each item must have:
- A checkbox (`- [ ]`)
- **What**: Specific action to take
- **Where**: Exact location (Railway dashboard URL path, CLI command, config file)
- **Verify**: How to confirm it worked (expected output, value to check)
- **Owner**: Who is responsible (defaults to "Ops" unless specified)

## Categories and Items:

### 1. Security Keys
- [ ] Set `KYCAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable in Railway for all three services (auth-service, profile-service, chat-service)
  - Where: Railway Dashboard > each service > Variables
  - Verify: `railway variables` shows KYCAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set (value is non-empty)
  - Source: PROJECT.md, CONCERNS.md

### 2. Monitoring
- [ ] Configure UptimeRobot monitors for all 3 service health endpoints
  - Where: UptimeRobot dashboard (uptimerobot.com)
  - Endpoints: `https://{auth-service-url}/health`, `https://{profile-service-url}/health`, `https://{chat-service-url}/health`
  - Verify: UptimeRobot shows "Up" status for all 3 monitors; alert notifications configured
  - Source: PROJECT.md, UPTIME-MONITORING.md

### 3. External Services
- [ ] Configure Apple Developer Portal Services ID for Android Apple Sign-In (OPTIONAL -- only needed if supporting Apple Sign-In on Android)
  - Where: Apple Developer Portal > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Services IDs
  - Verify: Apple Sign-In flow works from Android device/emulator
  - Source: PROJECT.md, STATE.md

### 4. Backup Validation
- [ ] Install AWS CLI and configure R2 access for backup operations
  - Where: Local machine / CI environment
  - Verify: `aws s3 ls s3://{bucket-name} --endpoint-url {r2-endpoint}` returns bucket contents
  - Source: PROJECT.md, docs/BACKUP_CONFIGURATION.md

- [ ] Execute backup restore test using the runbook
  - Where: Local development environment with test database
  - Verify: Restored database contains expected tables and recent data; runbook steps complete without errors
  - Source: PROJECT.md, docs/runbooks/

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Verify `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS` is set to >= 15 seconds for all three services
  - Where: Railway Dashboard > each service > Settings > Deploy
  - Verify: Value shows >= 15; graceful shutdown has time to complete before Railway kills the process
  - Source: STATE.md, Phase 9 summaries

- [ ] Verify Railway Custom Start Commands use `node dist/index.js` (not `npm start`) for all three services
  - Where: Railway Dashboard > each service > Settings > Deploy > Custom Start Command
  - Verify: Start command is `node dist/index.js` (avoids npm overhead and signal forwarding issues)
  - Source: STATE.md, Phase 9 PITFALLS research

### 6. Environment Variables
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables are set in Railway for each service:
  - **auth-service**: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV=production, PORT=3001, CORS_ORIGIN
  - **profile-service**: DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV=production, PORT=3002, CORS_ORIGIN
  - **chat-service**: DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV=production, PORT=3003, CORS_ORIGIN, FIREBASE_* (for push notifications)
  - Where: Railway Dashboard > each service > Variables
  - Verify: `railway variables` for each service shows all required vars set; no placeholder/empty values
  - Source: .env.railway.example, docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md

Also include at the top of the document:
- Title: "# Pre-Beta Operations Checklist"
- Description: "Operational prerequisites that must be completed before inviting real users to the VLVT beta. Each item is independently verifiable."
- Last updated date
- Progress summary (e.g., "0/8 items completed")

And at the bottom:
- A "Sign-off" section with space for date and confirmation that all items are verified

  <done>docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md exists with 8+ checklist items covering security keys, monitoring, external services, backup validation, deployment configuration, and environment variables. Each item has What/Where/Verify/Owner fields.</done>

<verification>
1. `docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md` exists
2. Contains at least 8 checklist items (matching the inventory from research)
3. Every item has: action description, location/where, verification method
4. Covers all categories: Security Keys, Monitoring, External Services, Backup, Deployment, Environment Variables
5. KYCAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY item is present (most critical security item)
6. Railway deployment draining seconds item is present (deployment safety)

<success_criteria>
- Pre-beta operations checklist exists at `docs/PRE-BETA-CHECKLIST.md` (OPS-01)
- Checklist consolidates ALL operational prerequisites from STATE.md, PROJECT.md, CONCERNS.md, and phase summaries
- Each item is independently actionable and verifiable
- No code changes required -- pure documentation
</success_criteria>
