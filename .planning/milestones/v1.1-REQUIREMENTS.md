# Requirements: VLVT Production Readiness

**Defined:** 2026-01-24
**Core Value:** When beta users sign up, their data must be secure, their privacy protected, and the app must not fail in ways that expose them to harm or embarrassment.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for beta launch. Each maps to roadmap phases.

- [x] **SEC-04**: BOLA/IDOR vulnerability check on all API endpoints with authorization fixes (60 endpoints audited)
- [x] **SEC-05**: Rate limiting configured on authentication endpoints
- [x] **SEC-06**: No hardcoded secrets in codebase (all moved to environment variables)
- [x] **SEC-07**: PII scrubbed from application logs (no emails, locations, message content)
- [x] **SEC-08**: Input validation hardened across all API endpoints
- [x] **SEC-09**: Socket.IO adapter upgraded from deprecated socket.io-redis to @socket.io/redis-adapter

### Monitoring & Alerting

- [x] **MON-01**: Sentry configured for production error tracking across all services

- [x] **UI-03**: Incomplete features completed or removed (no half-working functionality)
- [x] **UI-04**: Design consistency enforced (typography, spacing, colors, components)
- [x] **UI-05**: Error states and loading states reviewed and polished
- [x] **UI-06**: Edge cases handled (empty states, offline mode, timeouts)

### Safety Systems

- [x] **SAF-01**: Chat history preserved 30 days post-unmatch for moderation
- [x] **SAF-02**: Content moderation capability for reviewing reported content
- [x] **SAF-03**: Report handling workflow documented and functional
- [x] **SAF-04**: Ephemeral After Hours messages retained server-side (30 days) for safety

- **MON-09**: Anomaly detection alerting

### Enhanced Testing

- **TEST-07**: 70%+ backend test coverage
- **TEST-08**: Flutter E2E testing with Patrol
- **TEST-09**: Load testing for concurrent users

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New feature development | This is hardening, not feature work |
| 100% test coverage | Focus on critical paths; diminishing returns |
| SOC 2 certification | Not required for beta; consider post-launch |
| Performance optimization | Beyond critical issues; defer to post-beta |
| iOS background location fix | Known limitation; acceptable for beta |
| Interests/tags system | Deferred from v1.0; not production-readiness |
