# GSD State

**Project:** After Hours Mode
**Milestone:** v1.0
**Current Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Safety
**Status:** executing

## Position

- Phase: 01
- Wave: 1
- Plans: 01-01 (in_progress), 01-02 (complete), 01-03 (pending)

## Progress

```
Phase 1: [##--------] 1/3 plans complete
```

## Accumulated Decisions

- Model profile: quality (opus for executors, sonnet for verifier)
- Commit planning docs: true
- All workflow agents enabled (research, plan_check, verifier)
- [01-02] 500m default fuzz radius balances privacy vs utility
- [01-02] sqrt-based random distance prevents clustering near center
- [01-02] 3 decimal places (~111m) provides sufficient precision masking

## Current Context

Executing Phase 1 Wave 1 - database schema and location fuzzing utility in parallel.

Plan 01-02 (location fuzzing utility) complete. Location fuzzer ready for After Hours session endpoints.
