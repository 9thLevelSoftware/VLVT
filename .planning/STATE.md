## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Risk-priority ordering - security first, then GDPR, then testing, then monitoring
- [Init]: 7 phases derived from 7 requirement categories (38 total requirements)
- [Init]: Phase 7 includes v2 research items (device fingerprinting, photo hashing) as v2 scope
- [Revision]: Added Phase 4 (Bug Fixes & UI Polish) with UI-01 to UI-06 requirements
- [01-02]: SENSITIVE_FIELDS organized into 3 categories for maintainability
- [01-03]: Fire-and-forget async pattern for Redis adapter (non-blocking initialization)
- [01-03]: Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable (single-instance mode)
- [01-01]: @sentry/node minimum version ^10.27.0 to ensure security fix persistence
- [01-01]: Security fixes via semver ranges since package-lock.json is gitignored
- [01-04]: SEC-01 Document Railway TLS limitation with mitigations rather than disable SSL
- [01-04]: SEC-06 Add console.warn for dev secret usage to catch staging misconfiguration
- [01-05]: SEC-02 KYCAID encryption implemented; location encryption deferred to v2
- [01-05]: KYCAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY required in production (throws error if missing)
- [01-06]: SEC-04 SATISFIED - All 60 endpoints audited, 53 protected, 7 N/A (public auth)
- [01-06]: 5 authorization patterns documented for consistent IDOR protection
- [01-07]: TLS documentation consistent across all 4 utility scripts
- [02-01]: Used existing LegalDocumentViewer with LegalDocumentType enum for Settings navigation
- [02-01]: Data retention: 7 years audit logs (legal), 30 days messages after unmatch
- [02-01]: After Hours data: 1 hour session + 30 days safety retention period
- [02-02]: R2 photo deletion before database transaction (keys lost after CASCADE)
- [02-02]: Photo deletion failures logged but don't block account deletion (Right to Erasure priority)
- [02-02]: X-Internal-Service header for service-to-service authentication pattern

### Pending Todos

Phase 2 GDPR Compliance in progress. Next: 02-03 (consent management, data export).

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pre-existing test failures in auth-service, profile-service, chat-service (unrelated to security hardening work)
- Jest config conflicts in services (both jest.config.js and package.json jest key)
